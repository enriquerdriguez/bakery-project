# bakery-project

Baking Bread is a project for my Web Applications development course

The project has been done in a Cloud9 server. It consists on 2 parts:

- Wordpress page, just emulating a Bakery Web Page, with a blog with recepees and other themes.
- Point of Sale for the bakery. Programmed with PHP (no framework) using MVC and a management HTML template for the view.
